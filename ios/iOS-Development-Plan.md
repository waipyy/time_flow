# TimeFlow iOS App Development Plan

## Project Overview

### App Summary
The TimeFlow iOS app is a native SwiftUI implementation of the existing Next.js web application, designed for comprehensive time tracking with natural language input capabilities. The app will maintain full feature parity with the web version while adding iOS-specific enhancements like Screen Time integration, native notifications, and widgets.

### Key Features to Implement
- **Time Event Management**: Create, edit, delete, and view time events with start/end times and duration
- **Natural Language Input**: AI-powered parsing of time descriptions (e.g., "Worked on project for 2 hours")
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor time-based goals with progress visualization
- **Tag System**: Organize events with colored tags and filtering
- **Calendar Views**: Monthly and daily calendar interfaces
- **Dashboard Analytics**: KPI cards, time breakdown charts, and progress tracking
- **Screen Time Integration**: Automatic time tracking from iOS device usage data
- **Real-time Sync**: Seamless data synchronization with Firebase backend

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI with MVVM architecture
- **Backend**: Firebase iOS SDK (Firestore, Auth)
- **AI Integration**: Firebase Functions or direct API calls to existing Genkit flows
- **Screen Time**: Family Activity Framework (iOS 15+)
- **Local Storage**: Core Data for offline capabilities
- **Notifications**: UserNotifications framework
- **Widgets**: WidgetKit for home screen widgets

### Target Compatibility
- **iOS Version**: iOS 15.0+ (required for Family Activity framework)
- **Devices**: iPhone (primary), iPad (secondary support)
- **Architecture**: Universal (ARM64, x86_64 for simulator)

### Firebase Integration Patterns
- **Authentication**: Anonymous authentication initially, with option for user accounts
- **Firestore Collections**: 
  - `events/{userId}/events/{eventId}`
  - `goals/{userId}/goals/{goalId}`
  - `tags/{userId}/tags/{tagId}`
- **Real-time Listeners**: SwiftUI with `@StateObject` and Combine publishers
- **Offline Support**: Firebase offline persistence enabled
- **Security Rules**: User-based read/write permissions

### Data Flow and State Management
- **MVVM Architecture**: ViewModels manage business logic and Firebase communication
- **ObservableObject**: ViewModels conform to ObservableObject for SwiftUI binding
- **Combine Framework**: Handle async operations and data streams
- **Core Data**: Local caching for offline functionality
- **State Synchronization**: Optimistic UI updates with error handling

### Error Handling Strategies
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Firebase Errors**: User-friendly error messages with action buttons
- **Screen Time Permissions**: Graceful degradation when permissions denied
- **AI Parsing Errors**: Fallback to manual event creation
- **Offline Mode**: Queue operations for when connectivity returns

## Screen Time Integration

### Family Activity Framework Setup

#### Prerequisites
- iOS 15.0+ target deployment
- Family Activity capability in Xcode project
- Screen Time permission request flow

#### Permission Request Flow Implementation
1. **Initial Permission Check**: Check current authorization status
2. **Permission Request UI**: Present native permission dialog
3. **Permission Handling**: Handle granted/denied states gracefully
4. **Settings Redirect**: Guide users to Settings if permission denied

#### App Usage Monitoring Capabilities
- **Application Usage**: Track time spent in specific apps
- **Category Monitoring**: Monitor app categories (Productivity, Social, etc.)
- **Website Usage**: Track Safari and in-app browser usage
- **Device Pickup Events**: Monitor device unlock patterns

#### Automatic Time Event Creation Logic
1. **Usage Data Collection**: Gather app usage data at regular intervals
2. **Event Consolidation**: Merge continuous usage into single events
3. **Smart Categorization**: Map apps to existing tags automatically
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoid conflicts with manually created events
5. **Background Processing**: Handle data processing efficiently

#### Privacy Compliance Requirements
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary usage data
- **User Consent**: Clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **Local Processing**: Process sensitive data on-device when possible
- **Transparent UI**: Show users exactly what data is being tracked
- **Data Deletion**: Allow users to delete Screen Time-generated events

## Development Timeline Summary

**Total Estimated Time**: 70 hours (approximately 9-10 weeks at 8 hours/week)

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Setup & Foundation): 7 hours
- Phase 2 (Data Layer): 9 hours  
- Phase 3 (Core UI): 11 hours
- Phase 4 (Feature Implementation): 13 hours
- Phase 5 (iOS-Specific Features): 18 hours
- Phase 6 (Testing & Polish): 12 hours

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
1. Firebase integration must be completed before any data operations
2. Core models and ViewModels are prerequisites for UI implementation
3. Screen Time permissions must be working before usage data collection
4. All core features should be complete before performance optimization

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Start with Firebase integration early to identify any backend compatibility issues
- Test Screen Time integration on physical devices throughout development
- Implement offline support incrementally to avoid major refactoring
- Regular testing on various iOS versions and device sizes

This plan provides a structured approach to developing a feature-complete iOS app that maintains parity with the existing web application while adding valuable iOS-specific enhancements.
